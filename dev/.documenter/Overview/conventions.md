## Particles {#Particles}

Below is a table of the currently implemented particles (i.e. their particle properties are defined within the code)

| Particle | Abr. String | Mass (units of $m_\text{Ele}$) | Charge (units of $q$ the fundamental charge) |
| --------:| -----------:| ------------------------------:| --------------------------------------------:|
|   Sphere |     `"Sph"` |     1836.1528 (mass of Proton) |                                          0.0 |
| Electron |     `"Ele"` |                            1.0 |                                         -1.0 |
| Positron |     `"Pos"` |                            1.0 |                                          1.0 |
|   Proton |     `"Pro"` |                      1836.1528 |                                          1.0 |


## Grids {#Grids}

Three types of grids for coordinates in phase space have been implemented

| Grid Spacing | Abr. String |                                                                                                                                   Notes |
| ------------:| -----------:| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|      Uniform |       `"u"` |                                                                                 Uniform grid spacing between the upper and lower bounds |
|        Log10 |       `"l"` | Exponentially increasing grid spacing, uniform in Log10 space from upper to lower bounds (bounds should be given as Log10(bound value)) |
|       Binary |       `"b"` |         Fractionally decreasing grid spacing for angular grids. Bin widths half as they move away from u=0 in both directions to u=+-1. |


## Units {#Units}

Within Diplodocus, the speed of light $c$ is taken to be unity and all masses, momenta and energies are normalised by the rest mass of the electron $m_\text{Ele}$. Further all interaction rates are normalised by $\sigma_{T}c$, where $\sigma_{T}$ is the Thompson scattering cross section. Therefore time $t$ is given by $t [s] = t [\text{code units}] / \sigma_{T}c \approx 5\times10^{19}[s]*t [\text{code units}]$, with $t [code units]$ corresponding to the characteristic time for an interaction with cross section $\sigma_{T}$ and particle density $1 [m^{-3}]$.
