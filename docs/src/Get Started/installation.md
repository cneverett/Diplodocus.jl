# Installation

To use *Diplodocus* you will first need to install *Julia* on your machine (see guide for installing Julia [here](https://julialang.org/install/))

Then inside a Julia REPL you can install *Diplodocus.jl* using the julia package manager 
```julia-repl
juila> ] # ']' should be pressed
pkg> add Diplodocus
```

That's it! For guides on setting up simulations see the [Tutorials](@ref).
