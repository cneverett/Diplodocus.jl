Diplodocus is a novel framework for evolving the a set of particle distribution functions through the seven dimensions of phase space: one time, three space and three momentum. Evolution includes advection of particles, continuous forcing and discrete interactions (collisions) between particles.   

## Transport Equations for Particles
Transport equations refers to a set of equations that dictate the evolution of particles through phase space. In Diplodocus, that takes the form of an integrated Boltzmann equation: 
```math
\int_{\partial Q} f(\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol{p}) \boldsymbol{\omega} = \int_{Q} \boldsymbol{C}(\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol{p}),
```
``Q`` is a volume in phase space, ``f(\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol{p})`` is the particle distribution function, ``\boldsymbol{\omega}`` is the differential element for hypersurfaces ``\partial Q`` bounding ``Q``, such that ``f(\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol{p}) \boldsymbol{\omega}`` measures the fluxes of particles through those boundaries. The integration of ``\boldsymbol{C}(\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol{p})`` over the volume ``Q`` then measures the change of particles caused by collisions within ``Q``. For more in depth detail see [EverettCotter_2025](@citep).

## Distribution-In-Plateaux
To solve the evolution described by the transport equations computationally, a method called "Distribution-In-Plateaux" is used to discretise particle distribution functions. In brief, a continuous distribution over a surface in phase space is divided into a number of plateaux over sub-areas of the surface. The "height" of this plateaux is then taken to be the average value of the continuous distribution over that sub-area.

This discretisation allows interactions between particles to be pre-computed while simultaneously providing a flexible and conservative numerical scheme for the transport of distribution function through phase space. 

Pre-computation of collision terms is implemented in the `DiplodocusCollisions.jl` package. 

Transport of the distribution functions is handled by the `DiplodocusTransport.jl` package.

Plotting of results is split into a separate package `DiplodocusPlots.jl`.
